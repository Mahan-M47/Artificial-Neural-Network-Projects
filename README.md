# Artificial-Neural-Network-Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects I implemented for my Artificial Neural Networks course in fall 2022.

1. The first project (01 MLP) is focused on classifying the images in the Fashion MNIST dataset using a simple MLP network.
2. The second project (02 CNN) contains a convolutional neural network trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, with the goal of classifying images into 10 different classes.
3. The third project (03 ResNet) is a deep residual network classifying the images from the Intel Image Classification Dataset.
